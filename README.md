# SOBRIETY

## Inspiration 💡💡💡

SOBRIETY solves the problem of providing a secure and private platform for people in recovery to connect and communicate with each other. Traditionally, people in recovery might attend support groups or meetings, which can be time-consuming and may not always be convenient or accessible. SOBRIETY makes it easier for people in recovery to find peer-to-peer support and accountability, regardless of their location or schedule.

## What it does ❓❓

SOBRIETY provides a safe space for people in recovery to share their experiences, offer support, and find encouragement from others who understand their struggles. The app ensures the privacy of its users by utilizing the Hedera decentralized public network, which provides a fast and secure way to build decentralized applications. SOBRIETY is a valuable resource for people in recovery who are looking for a convenient, accessible, and private platform to connect with others who understand their journey and offer support and accountability.

## Features 💡
All multiple arguments for tasks.

## How we built it  💻💻
- We built our website using the following user flow diagram. We built it with Figma, with Hedera Heshgraph and emphasis on Web 3.0 in mind.
- Integrating different technologies, such as Express.js and Socket.io, into our project. This required a lot of debugging and troubleshooting to ensure that everything was working seamlessly together.

## Challenges we ran into
- While building SOBRIETY, we ran into a few technical challenges related to using the Hedera platform and building a decentralized app. One of the biggest challenges was understanding the complexity of the Hedera platform and its various tools and features. We had to spend a lot of time researching and experimenting with different features before we could effectively use them in our app.
- Another challenge we faced was setting up a secure and private chat system using Hedera. We had to develop and implement robust encryption methods to ensure that user data and communication remain secure and private. This required extensive research and testing to determine the most effective encryption techniques to use.
- One of the developers could no longer participate in the hackathon, leaving it up to us three to build the product
- First time using Express!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🤗

-Being able to get communicate using the Blockchain. 
-Working together as a small group.
Combining our creativity and research abilities to build a beautiful web application
- we faced some challenges with integrating different technologies, such as Express.js and Socket.io, into our project. This required a lot of debugging and troubleshooting to ensure that everything was working seamlessly together.
- To overcome these challenges, we spent a lot of time researching and experimenting with different features and technologies. We also reached out to the Hedera developer community and sought advice from experts to help us navigate through the complexities of the platform. Through perseverance and hard work, we were able to overcome these hurdles and create a functional and secure chat app for people in recovery.

## What we learned 📚📖📝
- We had to spend a lot of time researching and experimenting with different features before we could effectively use them in our app.
- Time limitations ⏰
- How to work on a team of half hackathon beginners and half hackathon regulars 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️

## What's next for SOBRIETY 📝
- Through perseverance and hard work, we were able to overcome these hurdles and create a functional and secure chat app for people in recovery.
- Transferring over to ReactJS
